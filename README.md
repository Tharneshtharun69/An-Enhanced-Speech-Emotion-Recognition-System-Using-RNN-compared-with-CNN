To run RNN CODE:
open the CNN folder,then WEB_APP folder in file manager. In the folder's address bar type cmd
type the following command in the command prompt and open the url that comes in the command prompt in web browser to predict the speech emotion using rnn algorithm with live speech data as well as pre recorded speech data
COMMAND:
python app.py 
the above is done using rnn algorithm.

To run CNN AND RNN CODES:
open a new notebook in google colab
load the files properly in colab by uploading the complete folder in the google drive.
open the notebooks uploaded in google drive in google colab run each cell one by one and finally you can see the better results in rnn than cnn.
